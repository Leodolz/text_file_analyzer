This is a sample input file, with many letters
spaces, punctuation and even some 22 numbers. Don't use invalid numbers, here is a valid large number
123456798012345678920, some invalid number would be 22,33.98. This file
has a lot of letters alongside with some out of words out of context which help have more data for the report.
But this 3rd time I went here with jdkalsd as an invalid word or incorect spelling.
A valid number is 132,333,445.980.
But this should be an invalid one 1,2,3.9. Despite many letters written here,
the letter z is only listed once, as one of the least used characters.

Another paragraph can start here.
